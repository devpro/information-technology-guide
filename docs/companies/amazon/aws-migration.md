## Products

### Application Discovery Service

> AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan your migration to the AWS cloud by collecting usage and configuration data about your on-premises servers and databases. Application Discovery Service is integrated with AWS Migration Hub and AWS Database Migration Service Fleet Advisor. Migration Hub simplifies your migration tracking as it aggregates your migration status information into a single console. You can view the discovered servers, group them into applications, and then track the migration status of each application from the Migration Hub console in your home Region. You can use DMS Fleet Advisor to assess migrations options for database workloads.

### Application Migration Service

> AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is a highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS. It allows companies to lift-and-shift a large number of physical, virtual, or cloud servers without compatibility issues, performance disruption, or long cutover windows. MGN replicates source servers into your AWS account. When you’re ready, it automatically converts and launches your servers on AWS so you can quickly benefit from the cost savings, productivity, resilience, and agility of the Cloud. Once your applications are running on AWS, you can leverage AWS services and capabilities to quickly and easily replatform or refactor those applications – which makes lift-and-shift a fast route to modernization.
